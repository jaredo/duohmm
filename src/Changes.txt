	*Haplotypes are now stored as vector<bool> which should improve memory efficiency.
	*Changed from double to float precision. No difference in output and better speed/memory.
	*Ordering of child haplotypes in a duo used to be (observed parent, unobserved). We now enforce (dad,mum) ordereding regardless of which parent was assayed.

	*DuoHMM now re-imputes genotypes that were missing in the original data using some simple inheritance rules. This avoids occasional Mendelian inconsistencies.

	*added SHAPEIT2 integration directly to the duohmm master repository. The duohmm src directory can now be copied directly to SHAPEIT2 and will compile seemlessly
